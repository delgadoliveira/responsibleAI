# Responsible AI Framework: Hate Speech Classification POC

## Overview

This project aims to develop a Proof of Concept (POC) for a responsible AI framework, specifically focusing on the classification of hate speech. The goal is to detect and mitigate instances of hate speech in AI-generated content, ensuring that it aligns with ethical standards and promotes a safe, inclusive digital environment.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this POC is to:
- Detect and mitigate hate speech in AI-generated content.
- Promote fairness and inclusivity by filtering content related to race, gender, and other sensitive topics.
- Enhance trust in AI systems by addressing abuse patterns and ensuring responsible AI usage.

## Components

1. **Content Classification**: Utilizes classifier models to detect harmful language related to hate speech in user prompts and outputs.
2. **Human Review and Decision**: Flags and logs hate speech content for authorized personnel to review and confirm the classification based on predefined guidelines.
3. **Content Filtering System**: Works with core models to detect and prevent harmful content in both input prompts and output completions.
